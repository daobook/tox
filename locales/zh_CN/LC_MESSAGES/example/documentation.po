"It's possible to generate the projects documentation with tox itself. The"
" advantage of this path is that now generating the documentation can be "
"part of the CI, and whenever any validations/checks/operations fail while"
" generating the documentation you'll catch it within tox."

"No need to use the cryptic make file to generate a sphinx documentation. "
"One can use tox to ensure all right dependencies are available within a "
"virtual environment, and even specify the python version needed to "
"perform the build. For example if the sphinx file structure is under the "
"``doc`` folder the following configuration will generate the "
"documentation under ``{toxworkdir}/docs_out`` and print out a link to the"
" generated documentation:"

"Note here we say we also require python 3.7, allowing us to use f-strings"
" within the sphinx ``conf.py``. Now one can specify a separate test "
"environment that will validate that the links are correct."
