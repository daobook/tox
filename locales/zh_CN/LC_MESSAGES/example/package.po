"Although one can use tox to develop and test applications one of its most"
" popular usage is to help library creators. Libraries need first to be "
"packaged, so then they can be installed inside a virtual environment for "
"testing. To help with this tox implements PEP-517_ and PEP-518_. This "
"means that by default tox will build source distribution out of source "
"trees. Before running test commands ``pip`` is used to install the source"
" distribution inside the build environment."

"To create a source distribution there are multiple tools out there and "
"with PEP-517_ and PEP-518_ you can easily use your favorite one with tox."
" Historically tox only supported ``setuptools``, and always used the tox "
"host environment to build a source distribution from the source tree. "
"This is still the default behavior. To opt out of this behaviour you need"
" to set isolated builds to true."
